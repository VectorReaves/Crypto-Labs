Project 4: Cryptocurrencies
Allison Brown and Zack 

	While cryptocurrency has been around for over a decade, (with Bitcoin being the first cryptocurrency available in 2009), it has not been until the past five years or so that the market has begun to take off. There are over 1,000 different cryptocurrencies available for users to choose from. The scope of our project will be focused on Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Cosmos, and Ethereum. Datasets found on data.world, kaggle, and investing.com.

With this data, we plan to analyze the historic data for each of these coins to generate visuals of price fluctuations for varying intervals of time in order to predict their future prices. Technology utilized will include Python Pandas with Scikit-learn, Javascript D3, Postgres or Google Cloud SQL, Flask, and Heroku.
